* arduino_LEDstrip_randomPoints

  Light up random points on the Adafruit LED strip.  See my other repository, [[../LEDStrand-WS2801-XY][LEDStrand-WS2801-XY]],
  for more info.

  At present, it lights up a small number of pixels in random locations and with random hues and
  then fades them down to darkness, a little like fireworks.
